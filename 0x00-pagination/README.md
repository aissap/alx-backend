This project involves implementing pagination for datasets, focusing on three main aspects: simple pagination, hypermedia pagination, and deletion-resilient pagination.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to paginate a dataset with simple `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.*).
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
  - Documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Setup

Use the `Popular_Baby_Names.csv` data file for your project. Make sure it is in the appropriate directory where your scripts can access it.

## Usage

Instructions on how to run your scripts and examples of expected output.

```bash
# Example command to run your script
